In this first preview of my visual project I have pictures of one of the best NFL players of the past year, LA Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp. On the bottom I have a picture of him from his college days at Eastern Washington University where he played D1 football. On either side of him I put his high school statistics. On the left I show how he was a 0 star recruit meaning he was not even ranked amongst the best high school players. On the left I put his collegee offers of which he only 2 compared to what other highly touted recruits received. Moving up I placed pictures of him in the NFL. You can see him run and smile. He has achieved success. Of course this is just a preview so there is more that I am not showing. I plan to put one more picture of him on the right as this 2021-2022 NFL season he had one of the greatest seasons a wide receiver has ever had if not the greatest WR season. Above each of the pictures of him in an LA Rams uniform I want to put his three accolades that no other WR has ever gotten in one season besides him and the GOAT Jerry Rice. The argument I will be putting forth is that you should never stop dreaming and that hard work can achieve anything. I am going to try to make the poster more dynamic but I have yet to figure that out.
